THEORY:
BF Algorithm is a primary method  for matching substring, and it musts to be known for a developer.

if some askes you for how to find a string in a file by programing, BF Algorithm will emerge in your head at once.
So, I also will tell you my awnser immediately. The Follows are my understanding about BF Algorithm. At first, we
need to get the length of string. Then, the length of s assigns to sl and the length of t assigns to tl. if sl or
tl is low of zero, there will be nothing we need to do. On the contrary, if sl and tl are both upon zero, we can
compare t to s in turn. if s[i] is equal to t[j], the indexs move to the next bothly. if s[i] is not equal to t[j],
we must alter i to i-j+i and alter j to 0. Finally, it is necessary for operating the result.

PESUDOCODE:

CODE:

//Brute Force Algorithm
int pm_bf(char *s, char *t)
{
    int sl=text_length(s);
    int tl=text_length(t);

    if(sl<=0||tl<=0) return -1;
    int i=0,j=0;
    while(i<sl&&j<tl)
    {
        while(j<tl)
        {
            if(s[i]==t[j])
            {
                ++i;
                ++j;
            }
            else
            {
                i=i-j+1;
                j=0;
            }
        }
    }
    return (j>=tl)?i-j:-1;
}
